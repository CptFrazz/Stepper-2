## Show number of steps taken on lockscreen/statusbar

### Intro
Stepper 2 is a jailbreak extension for iOS that allows the user to show the number of steps taken in a specific time period on the lockscreen and/or the statusbar.

### How do I Stepper 2?
Just install the tweak. In the settings you have many options to customize the look and the functionality of Stepper.

Note: Since this tweak fetches data from the motion coprocessor, it's iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus only. This is the iOS 8 version of [Stepper](https://github.com/shinvou/Stepper).

### How do I get?
Compile it for yourself, use the .deb included or buy it in the Cydia Store for just one dollar.

### How do I compile?
